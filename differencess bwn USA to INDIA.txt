Indians: The Indian system places a lot of emphasis on rote learning material. The focus is on absorbing as much knowledge as you can. Consequently Indians do well in quantitative subjects (science, engineering, maths...) where covering a lot of material takes you to a higher level of skill. However, knowledge is treated as facts and immutable truths rather than ideas to be assessed critically, so young Indians don't do as well in "soft" subjects and generally poor at critical or independent thinking. Schools for the most part completely ignore personality development and social skills.

American: The American system swings in the opposite direction with a greater emphasis on soft skills and creating a more rounded individual. As more time is spent on developing character, giving students broad exposure to different subject areas there is less time and incentive to delve deeply in to any subject area. What you get are more rounded individuals with broader cross subject knowledge but then weaker in specific subject areas than Indian counterparts.


It is also a HUGE misconception that American education is easy. I promise that it isn't. I came to the US thinking that I would excel. But, everyone was way ahead of me in academics, sports, debating, art, etc. I do experience a sort of inferiority complex here but I don't think that I can't improve. The environment is so academically stimulating and the teachers are so motivating (most of them) that very student works hard and tries to compete with his/her own self. 
Hope that helps :)

Sports : At my old Indian School, there was a very low priority given to sports compared to academics and very little resources dedicated to sports. Here at my new school, we compete in sports ranging from Football, Soccer, Tennis to Bass fishing. I used to be a scrawny kid in my old high school, but here, in my first year I tried out wrestling (but quit halfway; the injuries weren't worth it.

Overall Impression : Schools in India focus a lot on academics. Perhaps a bit too much. This leads to unnecessary stress and a kid who is not well rounded. Here in America, you can do what you like. Music, Theatre, Sports etc. Teachers are friendly, helping and well educated on their subject. Some teachers were good in India too, but that was not the norm. Corporal punishments were a thing.

Well first of all in India kids are taught to respect their family, teachers and elders. Its not the same in US.

The education in US is far more advanced(in terms of studying the recent technologies or advancement in respective fields) however in India we are still mugging up the textbook whose content dates back to some 5–6 decades.

The education in US emphasises mostly on practical understanding, understanding concepts. The professors give lecture on different concepts but they won't show you how to proceed with numerical problems. In India we are used to professors giving some examples about how to proceed with a particular numerical problem.

In India the curriculum is very specific while in US its very flexible. You can register for any subject from any department. I have seen people from Electrical Engineering taking music /psychology courses.

In US sports is encouraged a lot. They give equal importance to studies and sports. In India we are more focused on studying and getting good marks.


although education is more expensive in india through secondary education, USA more than makes up for that with its exorbitant fees for undergrad and grad courses.

Out of the pocket expenditure

A whopping 70% of the Indian population pays out of their own pocket for medical expenditures. This typically strengthens the financial mechanism of the insurance sector. In the US, the out of the pocket expenditure is much lower at 10-12%.

5. Health insurance is mandatory in the US, unlike India

In the US, it's mandatory to get health insurance and you have to pay a penalty if for some reason you choose not to get it. Employers in the US, as per government guidelines, are supposed to provide health insurance to their employees. None of the above holds true in India, where the provision or purchase of health insurance is up to the discretion of employers or individuals.

ndia’s economy is booming, but the benefits are going heavily to the rich.


Indian doctor’s office scenario:

A sick patient walks in to see a doctor
Waits 10–30 minutes
Doctor examines patient, history of diseases, familial medical background, allergies, environmental factors and prescribes medicine.

If specialist’s opinion is required, patient visits the specialist in less than a week, continues treatment and is eventually cured.
USA-
Sick patient at a walk-in clinic waits 1–3 hours with or without appointment
If specialist is required, patient makes an appointment by calling the specialist. Waits anywhere between 5 weeks to 2 months,

In the US doctors spend moretime on each patient and it is said that diagnostic testing is the norm. 
Indian Doctors devote far little “examination time” on each patient, seeing some 60 patients in three hours. Sometimes drugs are prescribed without physical examination
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

Indian healthcare system (Power in the hands of patient):

The patient is at the center and gets to choose the doctor he wants to see
Patient can see his test results and doctors report
Patient pays for the service
US Healthcare system (Power in the hands of Insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid):

Insurance companies, medicare and medicaid are at the center and you are restricted to seeing a doctor who is your insurance providers list (or else your insurance wouldn’t cover the expenses)
Test results are not given to the patient, instead they are sent to a doctor. You need to write a formal letter requesting your own test results and doctor report
Insurance company / medicare / medicaid pays for the majority of the cost

Main difference is that cost of healthcare in US is very high as compared to India. If you go by quality then there is not much difference, Indian healthcare is very advanced and is of international standards. This is the reason why medical tourism industry is alive. People from US come to India because they get high quality healthcare at low cost.

Education costs more in India than in America

7. Indian marriages are normally based on the social status of the families, while for Americans, it is based on their emotions.

I believe that arranged marriages work, and there is firm psychological evidence of why they do infact work, I boils down to natural constructs of human nature. Let’s break down these statistics into how they fit into the human psyche, as human beings it is a part of our nature to prefer the family. You see, it comes down to the evolutionary psychology of our ancestors where the familiar meant security, safety, comfort, and hospitality because the familiar were our kin. As human beings we are naturally attracted to others which are similar to our parents. For example if a girl hold features that remind you of your mother, that guy will become much more attracted to that girl, and the same for daughters and fathers. Since we prefer the familiar, parents will much more likely choose candidates who they feel share common interests and personality aspects with themselves, somebody that they can relate to. In turn, since parents will prefer and adore a candidate that they see as familiar and similar to them this will generate more attraction from the daughter or son because of the similar traits to that young adults parents. This being one psychological explanation behind this, I have left the strongest contributor for last it is a phenomena is the human psyche known as “The psychology of inevitability and the irrevocability of the decision”. As humans when we feel like something is inevitable, we will naturally generate reasons on our on on why that particular thing we are stuck with is good. The reasoning behind this goes with the Indian marriage system because since marriage is held at such a high standard because not only are you divorcing your mate, you are divorcing families and that is a high amount of pressure to put on one’s plate. However, if you can find something good in the permanent decision you just made you can avoid going through the harsh misery of spending the rest of your life with somebody you do not like and breaking it to your parents that the pick just wasn’t good enough. A research experiment was done at a horse betting track in which people were asked before and then after they had put money down on their horse on how confident they were in which their horse would win. The betters that were interviewed after the bet was already placed were much more confident in the horse they had recently not been as sure about. As you can see an arranged marriage is much more likely to work because of our human nature in regards to the circumstances in which we are placed, and this is just why arranged marriages work in my context.
